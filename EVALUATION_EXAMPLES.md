## Question 4
**Query:** "What mitigation steps does OWASP recommend for Injection vulnerabilities?"

**System Response:**
> OWASP recommends the following for Injection prevention:

*   Use a safe API, which avoids using the interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).
*   Use positive server-side input validation.
*   For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
*   Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
*   Source code review is the best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to injections; automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged [Source: owasp-top-10.pdf, Page: 1].
