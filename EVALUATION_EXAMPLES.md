## Question 3
**Query:** "What is the difference between a Tactic and a Technique in MITRE ATT&CK?"

**System Response:**
> Tactics represent the "why" of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique, which is the adversary's tactical objective [Source: mitre-attack-philosophy-2020.pdf, Page: 18]. Techniques describe the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals [Source: mitre-attack-philosophy-2020.pdf, Page: 11].

## Question 4
**Query:** "What mitigation steps does OWASP recommend for Injection vulnerabilities?"

**System Response:**
> OWASP recommends the following mitigation steps for Injection vulnerabilities:
*   Use a safe API, which avoids using the interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs) [Source: owasp-top-10.pdf, Page: 15].
*   Use positive server-side input validation [Source: owasp-top-10.pdf, Page: 15].
*   For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter [Source: owasp-top-10.pdf, Page: 15].
*   Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection [Source: owasp-top-10.pdf, Page: 15].
*   Source code review is the best method of detecting if applications are vulnerable to injections; automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is strongly encouraged [Source: owasp-top-10.pdf, Page: 15].

## Question 5
**Query:** "How does MITRE describe the purpose of Persistence techniques?"
